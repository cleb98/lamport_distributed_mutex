The most "real" implementation is the multiprocessing one.
I also reported the a simplest versione just use multithreading only for educational purpose.
(tbh also the mutiproccesing version is a toy-case developed to show how is possible to simulate a mutex on distirbuted system).
More info are in the specific readme in the multiprocessing/multithreading folders
