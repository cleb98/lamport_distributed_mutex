The most accurate implementation is the **multiprocessing** version. Additionally, a **simpler multithreading version** is provided purely for educational purposes. 
(To be honest, even the multiprocessing version is a toy example, designed to demonstrate how a mutex can be simulated in a distributed system.)  

For more details, refer to the specific **README** files in the **multiprocessing** and **multithreading** folders.
